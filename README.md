# XYZ

The XYZ language.

It is important to document each step in order to make it easier to write the thesis.

# Purpose

XYZ is a programming language in the form of a learning experiment to gain insight into language design and code interpretation. It sports a strongly typed system, which will make it more difficult for Undefined Behaviour to arise at compile time.

# Timeline

The project is divided in four stages.

## 1 -State of the art [ Started 2019-nov-05 ]

A look into already existing programming languages, their strengths and weaknesses and possible lessons learned for XYZ.

## 2 - Formal language specification

XYZ features, type system, flow control, functions, arguments, I/O, etc.

## 3 - Compiler design and implementation

Design lexical, syntax, and semantic analysis. Intermediate code generation. Optimisation. VM code generation.

## 4 - VM design

VM architecture design.
